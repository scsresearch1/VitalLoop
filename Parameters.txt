A. DIRECTLY EXTRACTABLE DATA (PROTOCOL-CONFIRMED)

These are already implemented in firmware + APK, no speculation.

1. Cardiovascular & Autonomic Signals

Heart Rate (interval + real-time)

Heart Rate History (timestamped)

HRV (time-domain records, 30-min resolution)

Continuous HR streaming (until explicit stop)

Resting HR inference (via low-activity windows)

Real-time HR alerts (if enabled)

2. Blood Oxygen (SpO₂)

SpO₂ measurements (interval-based)

SpO₂ enable/disable state

Measurement interval (configurable)

Real-time SpO₂ streaming (via Large Data service)

3. Blood Pressure (Estimated)

Systolic BP

Diastolic BP

Timestamped BP history

Batch retrieval (50 records per batch)

Important:
This is algorithmic BP, not cuff-based — but still physiologically valuable.

6. Sleep

Sleep start / end time

Sleep stages (segmented, 15-min or 5-min bins)

Sleep duration

Sleep continuity

Sleep interruptions

Sleep quality flags

Sleep history (up to ~29 days)

7. HRV-Derived Stress / Recovery

HRV records (multi-packet)

Time-aligned HRV with sleep/activity

HRV enable/disable state

HRV history

HRV stop/start control

8. Device Interaction & Touch

Touch events
